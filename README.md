## bitskins

A wrapper for the BitSkins API and Web Sockets.

```javascript
const Bitskins = require('bitskins');

const api = new Bitskins.API(apiKey, bitskinsSecret);
const sockets = new BitSkins.WebSocket();
```

## Installation
```javascript
$ npm install bitskins
```

## Features
- 100% coverage of the Bitskins API
- full compatibility with Bitskins' web sockets

## API

To make a call, you need to initiate the Bitskins.API class by passing
it your Bitskins API key which can be retrieved [here](https://bitskins.com/settings)
and by passing your Bitskins secret which is given to you when enabling 2FA
on your Bitskins account.

For more information, visit the [Bitskins API docs](https://bitskins.com/api).

 All calls return a promise with the data from the response. If there is
 an error making the request or the status of the request from Bitskins
 is not "success" the promise will be rejected.

 ```javascript
 api.getAccountBalance()
     .then((data) => {
         // ...
     })
     .catch((error) => {
         // this will be the response from the Bitskins API call if the actual
         // request was successful but the API returned a status that was not "success",
         // or it will be the error from the `request` module if the actual request failed.
     });
 ```

## Web Sockets

To use the Bitskins web sockets, you need to initiate the Bitskins Web Socket
class, no api key or Bitskins secret is necessary.

For more information, visit the [Bitskins Web Socket docs](https://bitskins.com/websockets).

```javascript
socket.on('connected', () => {
    // will now be able to listen for all other events
})

socket.on('disconnected', () => {
    // no longer able to listen to all other events
})
```

The way to listen to an event is set an event listener for `channel:event`,
currently there is only one channel to listen to events on.

```javascript
socket.on('inventory_changes:listed', (item) => {
    console.log(item)
})
```

| channel | event | description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| inventory_changes | listed | This event is fired whenever a new (purchasable) item is listed at BitSkins. |
| inventory_changes | delisted_or_sold | This event is fired whenever an item is no longer available for sale at BitSkins. |
| inventory_changes | price_changed | This event is fired whenever an item's price is changed by the seller. |
| inventory_changes | extra_info | This event is fired whenever we retrieve an item's extra information from Steam (such as floats, stickers, etc.). |
